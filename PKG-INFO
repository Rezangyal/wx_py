Summary: Py Suite including PyCrust and a revamped version, PySlices
License: wxWidgets (basically LGPL)
Description: An updated version of the popular PyCrust graphical shell that includes
        PySlices, a notebook-interface version of PyCrust. Like the original PyCrust,
        this requires wxPython to be installed.
        
        An experimental shell called SymPySlices is also available that works with (and
        requires) sympy. It also uses the ast module for dynamic symbol creation and
        requires Python 2.6.
        
        The PySuite updates have now also been included with the latest wxPython (import
        wx.py)!
